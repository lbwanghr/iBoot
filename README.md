If you like it, you can buy it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6465744342?pt=123719714&ct=Github&mt=8).

## Advanced Usage
In **geek mode**, you can reach the destination with one click on the icon, but you will lose access to the pull-down menu.

There is no entry for the geek mode in the GUI due to the Apple Review Guideline, however you can open **Terminal** and type the following command to enable geek mode.

`defaults write top.mightycounty.BootCampSwitcher geekmode true`

Or you can type the following command to disable geek mode. 

`defaults write top.mightycounty.BootCampSwitcher geekmode false`

Changes to geekmode will take effect after the next launch.

Additionally, you can type `sudo killall iBoot` to quit **iBoot** if you can't find a quit button.

## Get Windows 11
It's recommended to get Windows 11 by running a Windows 11 image on Windows 10.  

Learn more about it by reading [this](GetWindows11.md) article.

## Known issues
### Missing disk?
Sometimes you may find some of your disks are missing in the StartupDisk panel, don't worry, it's just not well been displayed due to the macOS. Feel free to click on an empty area where you think the disk should be placed, and you will notice the prompt changes just as you imagined.

### Not work?
Less than 1% said they couldn't open this app. However, before iBoot v1.1.5 was released, I had tested it on every major version of macOS with both Intel and M1 chip.  

There may be other situations that I haven't consideredï¼Œbut if you encounter a problem, please provide a screenshot of your **About My Mac** page and your demo video link which could reproduce the problem. I'll investigate it and get back to you as soon as possible.
