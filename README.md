In AppStore version, there is no Geekmode button due to the Apple Review Guideline. However you can open **Terminal** and type `defaults write top.mightycounty.BootCampSwitcher geekmode true` to enable the geekmode or you can type `defaults write top.mightycounty.BootCampSwitcher geekmode false` to disable the geekmode. This will take effect after the next launch.

Additionally, you can type `sudo killall iBoot` to quit **iBoot** if you can't find a quit button.
